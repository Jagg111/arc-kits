  // Light Ammo
  { id: "hairpin", name: "Hairpin", weaponClass: "Pistol", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Slide", damage: 20, rateOfFire: 9, dps: 180, range: 38.6, slots: ["Light Magazine"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "F", arc: "F", desc: "Single-action pistol with a built-in silencer that excels at stealth utility rather than combat. Its very weak armor penetration and slow handling make it poor in combat, but its quiet shots are ideal for disabling cameras, alarms, traps, or taking out isolated targets without alerting Raiders or ARC machines.", weakness: "Poor combat potential, attachments are not recommended" },
  { id: "burletta", name: "Burletta", weaponClass: "Pistol", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Semi-Auto", damage: 10, rateOfFire: 28, dps: 280, range: 41.7, slots: ["Muzzle", "Light Magazine"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "C", arc: "D", desc: "Serves as a lightweight, low cost alternative to heavier sidearms. Its high agility and decent accuracy make it great for mobile play and as a fast follow-up if your primary doesn’t finish a target. While its ARC penetration and raw damage are low, its quick handling and low repair cost make it a hidden gem budget build.", weakness: "Tiny magazine burns instantly" },
  { id: "kettle", name: "Kettle", weaponClass: "AR", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Semi-Auto", damage: 10, rateOfFire: 26, dps: 280, range: 42.8, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Light Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "B", arc: "D", desc: "Semi-auto workhorse with low recoil. Light ammo means weak ARC penetration—struggles against ARCs. Solid choice for player hunting if you land headshots.", weakness: "Bloom degrades accuracy over time" },
  { id: "stitcher", name: "Stitcher", weaponClass: "SMG", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 7, rateOfFire: 45.3, dps: 317.1, range: 42.1, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Light Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "A", arc: "D", desc: "Best common-tier close-quarters-combat weapon. High fire rate melts players close-range. Light ammo means terrible ARC penetration—useless against ARCs. High recoil needs control.", weakness: "Wild horizontal and vertical kick" },
  { id: "bobcat", name: "Bobcat", weaponClass: "SMG", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 6, rateOfFire: 66.7, dps: 400, range: 44, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Light Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Uncommon", pvp: "A", arc: "D", desc: "Fastest-firing submachine gun. Shreds unarmored players instantly. Weak ARC penetration and lower damage fail against ARCs and armored opponents. Recoil demands investment.", weakness: "Extreme recoil from insane fire rate" },

Small 12-round magazine limits sustained fights. Balanced choice for mixed encounters but outclassed by Tempest.", weakness: "Underwhelming overall performance" },

Requires precision and fire discipline. Scales with upgrades but demands significant investment for mediocre returns.", weakness: "Slow recovery between bursts" },
  { id: "renegade", name: "Renegade", weaponClass: "BR", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "Lever-Action", damage: 35, rateOfFire: 21, dps: 735, range: 68.8, slots: ["Muzzle", "Medium Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Rare", pvp: "A", arc: "B", desc: "Pinpoint mid-range powerhouse.

Medium ammo limits ARC breaking. Not accurate enough for most players—better options exist for overwatch role.", weakness: "Slow bullet velocity at distance" },

Lighter than most rifles, it keeps you mobile and frees inventory space for loot. Its slower handling and fire rate make precision key, but in PvP it is deadly in the hands of a skilled player. Its unique Tech Mod slot also enables builds that transform it into a close-range shotgun-like weapon.", weakness: "Relatively slow reload cycle, dispersion recovery is sluggish making rapid consecutive shots inaccurate" },
  { id: "bettina", name: "Bettina", weaponClass: "AR", ammoType: "Heavy", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 14, rateOfFire: 32, dps: 448, range: 51.3, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Stock"], rarity: "Epic", pvp: "D", arc: "C", desc: "Heavy-ammo hybrid excelling against both ARCs and players.
