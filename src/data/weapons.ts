  // Light Ammo
  { id: "hairpin", name: "Hairpin", weaponClass: "Pistol", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Slide", damage: 20, rateOfFire: 9, dps: 180, range: 38.6, slots: ["Light Magazine"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "F", arc: "F", desc: "Single-action pistol with a built-in silencer that excels at stealth utility rather than combat. Its very weak armor penetration and slow handling make it poor in combat, but its quiet shots are ideal for disabling cameras, alarms, traps, or taking out isolated targets without alerting Raiders or ARC machines.", weakness: "Poor combat potential, attachments are not recommended" },
  { id: "burletta", name: "Burletta", weaponClass: "Pistol", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Semi-Auto", damage: 10, rateOfFire: 28, dps: 280, range: 41.7, slots: ["Muzzle", "Light Magazine"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "D", arc: "D", desc: "Highest agility in the game makes it the fastest weapon to draw, aim, and swap to. Hip-fire accuracy is surprisingly strong, and headshots hit hard thanks to 2.5x multiplier. The 12-round mag is its downfall — without an extended mag you'll struggle to down a shielded Raider in one clip. Cheap to craft and repair. Pairs naturally with heavy-hitters like Anvil or Ferro which can also fill the gap on ARC penetration. Upgrading it improves reload speed.", weakness: "Tiny magazine burns instantly" },
  { id: "kettle", name: "Kettle", weaponClass: "AR", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Semi-Auto", damage: 10, rateOfFire: 26, dps: 280, range: 42.8, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Light Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "D", arc: "D", desc: "ARC penetration is weak, and compared to other automatic weapons its low damage per shot is often outclassed by simply spraying with a Stitcher or Rattler. Still, it rewards precise, rapid firing and can be a PvP contender when upgraded thanks to its stability and 2.5× headshot multiplier. It's light and cheap making it ideal for budget builds, free loadouts, or high-risk loot runs - and its 20-round mag and controlled recoil make it feel more accurate and versatile at mid range than many full-autos.", weakness: "Bloom degrades accuracy over time" },
  { id: "stitcher", name: "Stitcher", weaponClass: "SMG", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 7, rateOfFire: 45.3, dps: 317.1, range: 42.1, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Light Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "B", arc: "D", desc: "A high-agility SMG that shines in PVP as one of the highest sustained damage outputs among common weapons. Its spray and horizontal recoil make long-range fights messy, but in close quarters it melts shields and players alike. With upgraded and modded it becomes surprisingly competitive with higher-tier gear in tight engagements", weakness: "12 rounds vanish instantly" },
  { id: "bobcat", name: "Bobcat", weaponClass: "SMG", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 6, rateOfFire: 66.7, dps: 400, range: 44, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Light Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Epic", pvp: "S", arc: "D", desc: "Extremely high fire rate lets you delete Raiders in the blink of an eye. Skilled players can use it to overwhelm foes before they can respond, especially indoors or in chokepoints. It requires more resources to craft and keep repaired than common weapons, and its weak ARC penetration limits its PvE usefulness, but in close quarters PvP it's unmatched", weakness: "Extreme recoil from insane fire rate" },

  // Medium Ammo

Jack-of-all-situations, master of none, outclassed by most other guns. Moderate ARC pen handles Wasps and Hornets adequately. The 12 round base capacity paired with 2-bullet reload can feel punishing when you mag dump. Either upgrade the base weapon for more capacity or carry a sidearm as insurance.", weakness: "Low base ammo capacity and slow reloads" },
  { id: "arpeggio", name: "Arpeggio", weaponClass: "AR", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "3-Burst", damage: 9.5, rateOfFire: 18.3, dps: 173.9, range: 55.9, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Medium Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Rare", pvp: "D", arc: "C", desc: "The 3-round burst playstyle can be appealing to some. The delay between bursts hurts your DPS against moving targets and missing your target mid burst erodes your already-low DPS. You'll be dumping resources upgrades the base gun and attachments to make it barely competitive with base-level meta guns. Most people scrap it for parts, but don't let that stop you from trying it.", weakness: "Recoil & dispersion risk missing mid-burst. Requires investment to make competitive" },
  { id: "renegade", name: "Renegade", weaponClass: "BR", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "Lever-Action", damage: 35, rateOfFire: 21, dps: 735, range: 68.8, slots: ["Muzzle", "Medium Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Rare", pvp: "A", arc: "B", desc: "The mid-range king for peek-fighting and stand-offs. Lever-action mechanics require manual cycling between shots, rewarding deliberate aim over spray-and-pray. Top-tier for players who like to maintain distance or whittle down before the gap closes. Pairs well with close-range secondaries to cover all engagement distances. Works beautifully with a silencer for stealth play. Upgrade base weapon to help with fire rate.", weakness: "Bullet velocity feels sluggish at range" },
  { id: "venator", name: "Venator", weaponClass: "Pistol", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "Semi-Auto", damage: 18, rateOfFire: 36.7, dps: 660.6, range: 48.4, slots: ["Underbarrel", "Medium Magazine"], rarity: "Rare", pvp: "A", arc: "C", desc: "Fast TTK and high burst damage make it a PvP powerhouse. Crafting costs are steep, and upgrading is encouraged to increase fire rate/DPS, but it's performance justifies investment for PvP-focused Raiders. Loud shots will give away your position. Heavy for a pistol, making it best for players who prioritize winning fights over maximizing loot hauls.", weakness: "Default mag size" },
  { id: "torrente", name: "Torrente", weaponClass: "LMG", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 8, rateOfFire: 58.3, dps: 466.4, range: 49.9, slots: ["Muzzle", "Medium Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Rare", pvp: "B", arc: "C", desc: "Massive magazine capacity designed for suppressive fire and lane control. Significantly more accurate while crouched, encouraging stationary play that can make you an easier target. Works well at Level I, but upgrades reduce reload times and add more meaningful magazine capacity VS extended mags. Heavy weight and high repair costs mean most players reserve it for high-confidence runs with full squads rather than daily use. Solo players typically skip it for lighter, more mobile options.", weakness: "Shots spray everywhere without mods" },
  { id: "osprey", name: "Osprey", weaponClass: "SR", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "Bolt", damage: 45, rateOfFire: 17.7, dps: 796.5, range: 80.3, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Medium Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Rare", pvp: "B", arc: "D", desc: "Only weapon with built-in scope, making it ideal for long-range control and initiating fights. Excels at breaking shields, third-partying, and gathering intel from overwatch positions. Moderate ARC penetration means even a Ferro will outperform against ARC. Forced scope usage requires a strong CQC secondary. Medium ammo synergizes well with Tempest or Venator primaries.", weakness: "Slow bullet velocity at distance" },
  { id: "tempest", name: "Tempest", weaponClass: "AR", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 10, rateOfFire: 36.7, dps: 367, range: 55.9, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Medium Magazine"], rarity: "Epic", pvp: "A", arc: "C", desc: "Exceptional stability makes it laser-like at mid-range. Rare blueprint drops primarily from Night Raids. Crafting costs and repairs may not justify it over heavily upgraded & modded alternatives like a Kettle or Stitcher. Best as an entry into Epic-tier weapons if your economy can support it. Pairs well with precision secondaries like Ferro or Renegade for complementary range coverage. Upgrading it improves recoil control & reload time.", weakness: "Vertical climb during sustained fire" },

  // Heavy Ammo
  { id: "ferro", name: "Ferro", weaponClass: "BR", ammoType: "Heavy", fireMode: "Break-Action", damage: 40, rateOfFire: 6.6, dps: 264, range: 53.1, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Stock"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "C", arc: "B", desc: "Absurdly cost-effective for its power. Single-shot break-action forces deliberate positioning and peek-fighting, but rewards patience with devastating alpha damage. The lengthy reload punishes missed shots and close-range aggression. Ideally pair with a fast-firing secondary for followups or close quarters. Strong ARC penetration makes it the go-to budget ARC farmer at any progression level. Upgrades it improves reload time and mag size.", weakness: "Sluggish aim down sights speed" },
  { id: "anvil", name: "Anvil", weaponClass: "HC", ammoType: "Heavy", fireMode: "Single", damage: 40, rateOfFire: 16.3, dps: 652, range: 50.2, slots: ["Muzzle", "Tech Mod"], rarity: "Uncommon", pvp: "A", arc: "A", desc: "Six-shooter that hits as hard as Ferro without reload-per-shot punishment, making it a natural step up for PVP and PVE effectiveness. Slow base fire rate still rewards precision over spam. A frequent sidearm pick for players who want to graduate out of budget common grade weapons. Its unique Tech Mod slot can transform it into a close-range shotgun-like weapon. Pairs well with full-auto primaries. Upgrading it improves fire rate and readload time.", weakness: "Relatively slow reload cycle, dispersion recovery is sluggish making rapid consecutive shots inaccurate" },
  { id: "bettina", name: "Bettina", weaponClass: "AR", ammoType: "Heavy", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 14, rateOfFire: 32, dps: 448, range: 51.3, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Stock"], rarity: "Epic", pvp: "D", arc: "B", desc: "High rate of fire (for a heavy ammo based weapon) and proper magazine mechanice gives it high PvE DPS. However, it still has a slow fire rate compared to other weapons, which makes it less competitive in PvP. Heavy ammo consumption can strains supplies. Best for methodical ARC farmers who can afford the maintenance costs.", weakness: "Feels out of control during full-auto" },

  // Shotgun Ammo
  { id: "iltoro", name: "Il Toro", weaponClass: "SG", ammoType: "Shotgun", fireMode: "Pump", damage: 67.5, rateOfFire: 14.3, dps: 965.3, range: 20, slots: ["Shotgun Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Shotgun Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Uncommon", pvp: "C", arc: "D", desc: "CQC powerhouse built for ambush plays and corridor control. 2-3 shots drop most players, especially when all 9 pellets land. However, the pump-action cycle between shots leaves you exposed if you're not peeking or rolling. Shell-by-shell reloading makes running dry a death sentence in multi-target fights. Useless against ARC machines, so bring a proper primary for PvE. One of the cheapest weapons to craft and maintain for its stopping power. Upgrading it increases fire rate and adds magazine capacity.", weakness: "Tiny magazine punishes missed shots, pellets scatter without a choke" },
  { id: "vulcano", name: "Vulcano", weaponClass: "SG", ammoType: "Shotgun", fireMode: "Semi-Auto", damage: 49.5, rateOfFire: 26.3, dps: 1302.9, range: 26, slots: ["Shotgun Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Shotgun Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Epic", pvp: "S", arc: "D", desc: "Semi-auto dumps shells fast enough to drop players in under a second, regardless of their shield. It thrives in run and gun room clearing. Weak ARC penetration means you'll need a proper primary for PvE. More expensive to build and maintain than the Il Toro, so take your economy into consideration. Upgrading it improves fire rate and reload speed.", weakness: "Tiny mag punishes missed shots, pellets scatter without a choke" },

  // Special Ammo
  { id: "hullcracker", name: "Hullcracker", weaponClass: "Special", ammoType: "Special", fireMode: "Pump", damage: 100, rateOfFire: 20.3, dps: 2030, range: 38.9, slots: ["Underbarrel", "Stock"], rarity: "Epic", pvp: "F", arc: "S", desc: "Pump-action grenade launcher built for stripping ARC armor. Explosives only detonate on ARC, making it useless in PvP. The 5-round mag, slow projectile travel time, and pump cycling punish missed shots. Pair it with a heavy ammo weapon to finish off exposed weak points even faster. Best used in friendly lobbies or squads where teammates can watch for players while you focus fire. Upgrading it increases fire rate, tightening the gap between shots.", weakness: "Zero player damage, launcher ammo burns fast" },
  { id: "aphelion", name: "Aphelion", weaponClass: "BR", ammoType: "Special", fireMode: "2-Burst", damage: 25, rateOfFire: 9, dps: 216, range: 76, slots: ["Underbarrel", "Stock"], rarity: "Legendary", pvp: "C", arc: "A", desc: "Energy rifle for peek-fighting and controlled aggression at mid-to-long range. The 10-round mag consumes 2 bullets per burst, giving you 5 clicks of burst fire. It rewards deliberate shot pacing — pop out, land both rounds, reposition. Rips through ARC with strong penetration. Will struggle in CQC against full-autos due to the delay between bursts. Expensive to craft and maintain, so a strong economy is needed. Cannot be upgraded.", weakness: "Burst recoil splits shots at range" },
  { id: "jupiter", name: "Jupiter", weaponClass: "SR", ammoType: "Special", fireMode: "Bolt", damage: 60, rateOfFire: 7.7, dps: 423.5, range: 71.7, slots: [], rarity: "Legendary", pvp: "F", arc: "S", desc: "Bolt-action energy railgun that charges up to fire and delivers the highest single-hit damage in the game. Acts like hit scan making landing easier to land, but miss and the cycle time leaves you exposed. Very strong ARC penetration that will obliterate them. The unqiue sound and beam trail mean there's no hiding. No attachment or upgrades and steep crafting costs make it a purpose built ARC killer.", weakness: "No attachment slots, cannot be upgraded" },
  { id: "equalizer", name: "Equalizer", weaponClass: "Special", ammoType: "Special", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 8, rateOfFire: 33.3, dps: 266.4, range: 68.6, slots: [], rarity: "Legendary", pvp: "F", arc: "S", desc: "Full-auto energy beam that acts like a laser minigun. The 50-round mag and continuous fire let you apply relentless pressure. Very strong ARC penetration strips armor and exposes weak points fast. Very effective for safely dismantling ARC bosses. It's the heaviest weapon in the game killing your mobility and making repositioning painful. Can hold it's own in PvP, but chances are you'll still want a PvP oriented secondary. Requires a Queen Reactor to craft, no upgrades or attachments.", weakness: "No attachment slots, cannot be upgraded" },
