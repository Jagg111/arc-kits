  // Light Ammo
  { id: "hairpin", name: "Hairpin", weaponClass: "Pistol", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Slide", damage: 20, rateOfFire: 9, dps: 180, range: 38.6, slots: ["Light Magazine"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "F", arc: "F", desc: "Single-action pistol with a built-in silencer that excels at stealth utility rather than combat. Its very weak armor penetration and slow handling make it poor in combat, but its quiet shots are ideal for disabling cameras, alarms, traps, or taking out isolated targets without alerting Raiders or ARC machines.", weakness: "Poor combat potential, attachments are not recommended" },
  { id: "burletta", name: "Burletta", weaponClass: "Pistol", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Semi-Auto", damage: 10, rateOfFire: 28, dps: 280, range: 41.7, slots: ["Muzzle", "Light Magazine"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "D", arc: "D", desc: "Highest agility in the game makes it the fastest weapon to draw, aim, and swap to. Hip-fire accuracy is surprisingly strong, and headshots hit hard thanks to 2.5x multiplier. The 12-round mag is its downfall — without an extended mag you'll struggle to down a shielded Raider in one clip. Cheap to craft and repair. Pairs naturally with heavy-hitters like Anvil or Ferro which can also fill the gap on ARC penetration. Upgrading it improves reload speed.", weakness: "Tiny magazine burns instantly" },
  { id: "kettle", name: "Kettle", weaponClass: "AR", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Semi-Auto", damage: 10, rateOfFire: 26, dps: 280, range: 42.8, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Light Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "D", arc: "D", desc: "ARC penetration is weak, and compared to other automatic weapons its low damage per shot is often outclassed by simply spraying with a Stitcher or Rattler. Still, it rewards precise, rapid firing and can be a PvP contender when upgraded thanks to its stability and 2.5× headshot multiplier. It's light and cheap making it ideal for budget builds, free loadouts, or high-risk loot runs - and its 20-round mag and controlled recoil make it feel more accurate and versatile at mid range than many full-autos.", weakness: "Bloom degrades accuracy over time" },
  { id: "stitcher", name: "Stitcher", weaponClass: "SMG", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 7, rateOfFire: 45.3, dps: 317.1, range: 42.1, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Light Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "B", arc: "D", desc: "A high-agility SMG that shines in PVP as one of the highest sustained damage outputs among common weapons. Its spray and horizontal recoil make long-range fights messy, but in close quarters it melts shields and players alike. With upgraded and modded it becomes surprisingly competitive with higher-tier gear in tight engagements", weakness: "12 rounds vanish instantly" },
  { id: "bobcat", name: "Bobcat", weaponClass: "SMG", ammoType: "Light", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 6, rateOfFire: 66.7, dps: 400, range: 44, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Light Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Epic", pvp: "S", arc: "D", desc: "Extremely high fire rate lets you delete Raiders in the blink of an eye. Skilled players can use it to overwhelm foes before they can respond, especially indoors or in chokepoints. It requires more resources to craft and keep repaired than common weapons, and its weak ARC penetration limits its PvE usefulness, but in close quarters PvP it's unmatched", weakness: "Extreme recoil from insane fire rate" },

  // Medium Ammo

Jack-of-all-situations, master of none, outclassed by most other guns. Moderate ARC pen handles Wasps and Hornets adequately. The 12 round base capacity paired with 2-bullet reload can feel punishing when you mag dump. Either upgrade the base weapon for more capacity or carry a sidearm as insurance.", weakness: "Low base ammo capacity and slow reloads" },
  { id: "arpeggio", name: "Arpeggio", weaponClass: "AR", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "3-Burst", damage: 9.5, rateOfFire: 18.3, dps: 173.9, range: 55.9, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Medium Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Rare", pvp: "D", arc: "C", desc: "The 3-round burst playstyle can be appealing to some. The delay between bursts hurts your DPS against moving targets and missing your target mid burst erodes your already-low DPS. You'll be dumping resources upgrades the base gun and attachments to make it barely competitive with base-level meta guns. Most people scrap it for parts, but don't let that stop you from trying it.", weakness: "Recoil & dispersion risk missing mid-burst. Requires investment to make competitive" },
  { id: "renegade", name: "Renegade", weaponClass: "BR", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "Lever-Action", damage: 35, rateOfFire: 21, dps: 735, range: 68.8, slots: ["Muzzle", "Medium Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Rare", pvp: "A", arc: "B", desc: "The mid-range king for peek-fighting and stand-offs. Lever-action mechanics require manual cycling between shots, rewarding deliberate aim over spray-and-pray. Top-tier for players who like to maintain distance or whittle down before the gap closes. Pairs well with close-range secondaries to cover all engagement distances. Works beautifully with a silencer for stealth play. Upgrade base weapon to help with fire rate.", weakness: "Bullet velocity feels sluggish at range" },
  { id: "venator", name: "Venator", weaponClass: "Pistol", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "Semi-Auto", damage: 18, rateOfFire: 36.7, dps: 660.6, range: 48.4, slots: ["Underbarrel", "Medium Magazine"], rarity: "Rare", pvp: "A", arc: "C", desc: "Fast TTK and high burst damage make it a PvP powerhouse. Crafting costs are steep, and upgrading is encouraged to increase fire rate/DPS, but it's performance justifies investment for PvP-focused Raiders. Loud shots will give away your position. Heavy for a pistol, making it best for players who prioritize winning fights over maximizing loot hauls.", weakness: "Default mag size" },
  { id: "torrente", name: "Torrente", weaponClass: "LMG", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 8, rateOfFire: 58.3, dps: 466.4, range: 49.9, slots: ["Muzzle", "Medium Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Rare", pvp: "B", arc: "C", desc: "Massive magazine capacity designed for suppressive fire and lane control. Significantly more accurate while crouched, encouraging stationary play that can make you an easier target. Works well at Level I, but upgrades reduce reload times and add more meaningful magazine capacity VS extended mags. Heavy weight and high repair costs mean most players reserve it for high-confidence runs with full squads rather than daily use. Solo players typically skip it for lighter, more mobile options.", weakness: "Shots spray everywhere without mods" },
  { id: "osprey", name: "Osprey", weaponClass: "SR", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "Bolt", damage: 45, rateOfFire: 17.7, dps: 796.5, range: 80.3, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Medium Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Rare", pvp: "B", arc: "D", desc: "Only weapon with built-in scope, making it ideal for long-range control and initiating fights. Excels at breaking shields, third-partying, and gathering intel from overwatch positions. Moderate ARC penetration means even a Ferro will outperform against ARC. Forced scope usage requires a strong CQC secondary. Medium ammo synergizes well with Tempest or Venator primaries.", weakness: "Slow bullet velocity at distance" },
  { id: "tempest", name: "Tempest", weaponClass: "AR", ammoType: "Medium", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 10, rateOfFire: 36.7, dps: 367, range: 55.9, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Medium Magazine"], rarity: "Epic", pvp: "A", arc: "C", desc: "Exceptional stability makes it laser-like at mid-range. Rare blueprint drops primarily from Night Raids. Crafting costs and repairs may not justify it over heavily upgraded & modded alternatives like a Kettle or Stitcher. Best as an entry into Epic-tier weapons if your economy can support it. Pairs well with precision secondaries like Ferro or Renegade for complementary range coverage. Upgrading it improves recoil control & reload time.", weakness: "Vertical climb during sustained fire" },

  // Heavy Ammo
  { id: "ferro", name: "Ferro", weaponClass: "BR", ammoType: "Heavy", fireMode: "Break-Action", damage: 40, rateOfFire: 6.6, dps: 264, range: 53.1, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Stock"], rarity: "Common", pvp: "C", arc: "B", desc: "Absurdly cost-effective for its power. Single-shot break-action forces deliberate positioning and peek-fighting, but rewards patience with devastating alpha damage. The lengthy reload punishes missed shots and close-range aggression. Ideally pair with a fast-firing secondary for followups or close quarters. Strong ARC penetration makes it the go-to budget ARC farmer at any progression level. Upgrades it improves reload speed.", weakness: "Sluggish aim down sights speed" },
  { id: "anvil", name: "Anvil", weaponClass: "HC", ammoType: "Heavy", fireMode: "Single", damage: 40, rateOfFire: 16.3, dps: 652, range: 50.2, slots: ["Muzzle", "Tech Mod"], rarity: "Uncommon", pvp: "A", arc: "A", desc: "Six-shooter that hits as hard as Ferro without reload-per-shot punishment, making it a natural step up for PVP and PVE effectiveness. Slow base fire rate still rewards precision over spam. A frequent sidearm pick for players who want to graduate out of budget common grade weapons. Its unique Tech Mod slot can transform it into a close-range shotgun-like weapon. Pairs well with full-auto primaries. Upgrading it significantly improves fire rate.", weakness: "Relatively slow reload cycle, dispersion recovery is sluggish making rapid consecutive shots inaccurate" },
  { id: "bettina", name: "Bettina", weaponClass: "AR", ammoType: "Heavy", fireMode: "Full-Auto", damage: 14, rateOfFire: 32, dps: 448, range: 51.3, slots: ["Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Stock"], rarity: "Epic", pvp: "D", arc: "B", desc: "High rate of fire (for a heavy ammo based weapon) and proper magazine mechanice gives it high PvE DPS. However, it still has a slow fire rate compared to other weapons, which makes it less competitive in PvP. Heavy ammo consumption can strains supplies. Best for methodical ARC farmers who can afford the maintenance costs.", weakness: "Feels out of control during full-auto" },

  // Shotgun Ammo
  { id: "iltoro", name: "Il Toro", weaponClass: "SG", ammoType: "Shotgun", fireMode: "Pump", damage: 67.5, rateOfFire: 14.3, dps: 965.3, range: 20, slots: ["Shotgun Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Shotgun Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Uncommon", pvp: "C", arc: "D", desc: "Point-blank delete button. Two-taps light shields. Useless beyond 5 meters. Slow reload punishes misses. Zero ARC penetration—player-hunting only.", weakness: "Pellet spread inconsistent" },
  { id: "vulcano", name: "Vulcano", weaponClass: "SG", ammoType: "Shotgun", fireMode: "Semi-Auto", damage: 49.5, rateOfFire: 26.3, dps: 1302.9, range: 26, slots: ["Shotgun Muzzle", "Underbarrel", "Shotgun Magazine", "Stock"], rarity: "Epic", pvp: "S", arc: "D", desc: "Fastest player time-to-kill in game. Semi-auto allows instant follow-ups. Weak ARC penetration fails against ARCs. Choke mandatory for consistency. Dominant in close-quarters-combat.", weakness: "Pellet spread unreliable without choke" },

  // Special Ammo
  { id: "hullcracker", name: "Hullcracker", weaponClass: "Special", ammoType: "Special", fireMode: "Pump", damage: 100, rateOfFire: 20.3, dps: 2030, range: 38.9, slots: ["Underbarrel", "Stock"], rarity: "Epic", pvp: "F", arc: "S", desc: "Grenade launcher. Strips ARC armor but inaccurate. Zero player damage—literally useless in player-versus-player. Niche armor-peeling role. Patch nerfs hurt viability.", weakness: "Terrible handling" },

Massive ARC damage but ammo scarcity limits operations. Dedicated boss farming—not versatile. No attachments possible.", weakness: "No attachment slots" },
